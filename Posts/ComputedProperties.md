# Computed Properties in Swift

This post is going to explain what a computed property is and how to use it.

# What is a Computed Property?

A computed property is similar to a [stored property](link to post), except a computer property does not hold a value. A computed property's value is calculated based on the provided **getter** defined for the property. A computed property can also affect other properties in the class, struct, or enumeration by using a **setter**.
